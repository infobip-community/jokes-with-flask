# jokes-with-flask
A Flask app that uses the Infobip Python SDK and JokeAPI to send programming puns to your phone

# Running locally
This repo provides the config for a devcontainer. You can also use a virtual Python environment (venv, virtualenv, pipenv) and run `python3 -m pip intall requirements.txt` in your virtual env.

Once you have the requirements installed, `flask run` from the top-level directory will serve the app on localhost:5000.
